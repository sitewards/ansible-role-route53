# The zone that you want to add. Route53 controls "zones", or a set of domains. Often times it's just the root domain,
# but not always. If you don't know yours, take a look in Route53:

# (Required)
# route53_zone: __YOUR_ZONE_HERE__

# The record that you want to create. This is the full domain name, including the zone

# How long a DNS resolver should wait until it re-checks the DNS record (in seconds). DNS is heavily cached; a lower TTL
# will mean a performance hit more often, but a higher TTL makes it hard to change records. The default (5 minutes) is
# pretty safe
route53_ttl: "300"

# The records that you wish to attach to the zone. You can have multiple records -- for example, if you want to have
# redundancy in your load balancers, you can add two IPs here. If that happens, the first connection will fail, but the
# second will not, and the second value will be cached.
